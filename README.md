I am Israfil Argos, a hobbyist programmer and creative author. I like making game engines, small embedded projects, and other things. I'm a C fellow, but have been recently experimenting with C++ (I like namespaces) and Javascript (no comment). As for writing, fantasy is probably my favorite and strongest area.

If you've got any questions, feel free to contact me via my [buisness email](mailto:israfiel_buisness.nearly025@passfwd.com).
